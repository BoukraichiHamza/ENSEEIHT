Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           676 out of  17,344    3%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             4,016 out of  17,344   23%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,425 out of   8,672   27%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,425 out of   2,425 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,425   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,016 out of  17,344   23%
    Number used as logic:             2,992
    Number used for 32x1 RAMs:        1,024
      (Two LUTs used per 32x1 RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 33 out of     250   13%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      24

  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                1 out of      28    3%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.97

Peak Memory Usage:  299 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  7 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   6 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Map:285 - The MAP option "-ise" is being deprecated in the next major
   software release.
WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <btn<1>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <btn<2>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <btn<3>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal

INFO:Security:52 - The LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'2100@flexwin.enseeiht.fr'.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s1200e' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network btn<3>_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 2 more times for the following

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
